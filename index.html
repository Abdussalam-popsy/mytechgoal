        <p>I would like to be competent in both design and development, building a career as a UX engineer or design engineer.</p>
        <p>I strive to have the opportunity to work with startups as a full-time designer/design engineer building a product end-end.</p>
        <p>I would also like to keep freelancing, working with cool founders and businesses on cool projects that excite me.</p>
        <p>In 2 years time, I would be in my penultimate year at University. I hope my tech career takes off before i graduate.</p>
        <p>I don’t know exactly where I’ll be in two years but I do love the idea of combining design and development to forge a career path in design engineering.</p>
        <p>To make this a reality, I’ll be attending HNG (11) as a front-end developer and design intern to learn new skills and connect with ambitious folks while building a solid foundation for the career aspirations I hope to attain.</p>
